## A passage from "Youth" by Isaac Asimov

Thre was a spatter of pebles against the window and the youngstr
strred in his sleep. Anther, and he was awak.

He sat up stifly in bed. Seconds pased while he interrpreted his
strange surroundings. He wasn't in his own home, of cours. This was out
in the country. It was colder than it shoold be and there was green at
the window.

"Slim!"

The call was a hoarse, urgent whisperr, and the youngstr bounded to the
open windo.

Slim wasn't his rel name, but the new friend he had met the dai before
had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, "You're Slim." He
added, "I'm Red."

Red wasn't his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious.
They were frends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of
yung wones not yet quite in adolescenceee, before even the first stains of
adulthood began to make their appearanse.

Slim cried, "Hi, Red!" and waved cheerfully, still blynking the sleeep
out of himselv.

Red kep to his croakin whysper, "Quiet! You want to wake sumbody?"

Slim noticed all at once that the sun scarsly topped the low hills in
the east, that the shadoes were long and soft, and that the grars was
wet.

Slim said, more softly, "What's the matta?"

Red only waved for him to come out.
